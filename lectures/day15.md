# Midterm

**Day 17:  Tuesday, March 19, 2013 -- in class**

The midterm is an opportunity to review and consolidate the materials we've
covered so far in class. Questions will focus on large conceptual understanding
of the materials and will draw heavily from the problem sets, project proposals,
the guest lectures, and the data sets we've analyzed. Programming questions
won't require a computer to answer.

A reminder of the assigned reading so far:

   * Python for Data Analysis (PfDA), Chapters 1-5, 8, Appendix (review of Python) 
   * [Courtlistener slides](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-NkkRVaYqkUUFRfNXFhWnIydXM/edit?usp=sharing&pli=1) 
   * [early readings on open data, data.gov](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/blob/master/lectures/day01.html#(13))

The technical materials in the class we've covered:

   * Python constructs: itertools  (e.g., islice), generators, datetime.datetime, time, requests library [Day 10, p 10](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/blob/master/lectures/day10.html#(10))
   * basics of numpy and Pandas Series, DataFrame ( slice notation, groupby) at the level of techniques used in the problem sets (https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2013/info290t/resources -> HW Days 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14

Data sets we've studied:

   * [census data set](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/tree/master/data/census)
   * [usa.gov bit.ly](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book/blob/master/ch02/usagov_bitly_data2012-03-16-1331923249.txt)
   * [baby names](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book/tree/master/ch02/names)

As for your projects: be prepared to answer questions about your project
proposals. That is, even though you are proposing group projects, each of you
should be able to answer fundamental questions about your proposal.
