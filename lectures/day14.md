# Project Proposals due this Friday

Due by Friday, March 8 at noon: a project proposal that will
serve our learning goals and a solid effort at answering questions listed in
[Project Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.dd0cno55yf1j).

**I hope that your project is a topic you find fascinating, because it will help with your learning!!**

Answer the following questions in <http://bit.ly/wwod13projideas>

* What's the title for your project?

* Who are your team members (2-4 members)?

* What are some open-ended questions of your project?

* What are some concrete immediate first/next steps in your projects?

* What open data sets do you plan to work with? (Show that the data set(s) you
  plan to work with are indeed open.)

* What are possible ties to Wikipedia (or any Wikimedia related projects)?

* What challenges do you anticipate running into?

* What skills will a team need to develop to solve this problem?

* In what way (if any) are you also getting credit for work you are planning to
  do in this project in another UC Berkeley course?

Make sure:

* Your project is listed under the [Project Ideas](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.ambnowk87ix) section
* You link to the project in the [Who's Interested in What?](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.vdzddpatp9vq) section under your name.
* By specific data, I mean something you can
meaningfully use what we have learned to produce a pandas `DataFrame` and answer a useful (even if simple and preliminary) question. List the
data source in the project idea section.
