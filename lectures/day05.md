# Agenda

*  Continue working through [Day 4 Starter iPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/master/notebooks/Day_04_starter.ipynb)

Reminder: this homework is due *Friday, Feb 8 at noon*.  Submit to <yee@berkeley.edu> by email.

## Announcements

* Brian Carver will be here on Feb 14 to talk about <http://courtlistener.com/>
* Jacob has regular (?) office hours on Monday afternons.


# Homework for Day 2 graded

* Grades for Day 2 HW released in <bspace.berkeley.edu>:
  
    * 4 if notebook works
    * 3 if it's mostly working
    * 2 if you have are on your way
    * 1 if you submitted it and made minimal effort

    
## What I'd like to see

   * review how to use `collections.Counter` -- I'm intrigued by the various ways in which some of you passed in an entire iterable or pass in one item at a time.
   * **please label your file with your first and last name**
   * I'd appreciate your making it as easy for me to grade as possible:
      * you can keep your output, but I'll also clear your output and run your notebook -- so make sure things work
      * if things don't work, put in your own comments as to where you left off and the help you would like.
   * trailing "\\n" in state names -- I think it's a nice touch to get rid of them.
