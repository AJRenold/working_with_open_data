## Event tomorrow

[Software is Rebooting Journalism: Data Mining and Visualization in the Public Interest](http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/coe.html?event_ID=61199)

Wednesday, March 6, 2013 -- 306 Soda Hall (HP Auditorium) 4:00 - 5:00 pm / 3:30 - Refreshments will be served

Jeff Larson
News Applications developer, ProPublica

ABSTRACT:

ProPublica is a non profit news outlet in New York City that publishes
investigative journalism. They also have a team of seven News Application
developers who create software that tells stories and finds meaningful stories
in data. Their News Applications include databases such as Dollars for Doctors,
which lists pharmaceutical company payments to doctors, and the Message Machine,
an application that uses Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to
reverse engineer political email targeting. Jeff Larson will talk about the
evolution of this new field of journalism and show off a few of ProPublica's
News Applications.

# Homework solutions Posted / Getting Help

I've uploaded the answers to Day 10 homework, which was due on Friday:

* [Day_10_A_fixed_width_parsing_completed.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/master/notebooks/Day_10_A_fixed_width_parsing_completed.ipynb)
* [Day_10_freebase_cursor_completed.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/master/notebooks/Day_10_freebase_cursor_completed.ipynb)

BTW, you can follow [commits on github for the working-open-data repository](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data/commits/master).

I'm backlogged on grading homework.  I've posted homework solutions for all the problem sets.

**I count on you as graduate students to contact me when you need help.  Please don't hesitate to talk to me, come to my office hours, and
post questions to Piazza.**

# Continuing Learning Pandas 

We've taken a first pass at the major pieces of `PfDA` but we now need to get conversant by practice -- on the examples in `PfDA` and
increasingly on the data sets in the projects.

## Good lectures I can commend on YouTube:

   * [Introduction to NumPy and Matplotlib](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fp1zn5ao2M)
   * [Advanced Matplotlib](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmpWIC5SctY)

# Working with Data Sets in PfDA

<https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book>

For example:

* calculating the most common domain names in [usagov_bitly_data2012-03-16-1331923249.txt](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book/blob/master/ch02/usagov_bitly_data2012-03-16-1331923249.txt)
* verifying that the timestamps represented in the file do actually fall on 2012-03-16

Think of questions you have for the 3 data sets in Chapter 2, and we'll come back to seeing whether/how to answer them:

# Project Proposals due this Friday

Due by Friday, March 8 at noon: a project proposal that will
serve our learning goals and a solid effort at answering questions listed in
[Project Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.dd0cno55yf1j).

**I hope that your project is a topic you find fascinating, because it will help with your learning!!**

Answer the following questions in <http://bit.ly/wwod13projideas>

* What's the title for your project?

* Who are your team members (2-4 members)?

* What are some open-ended questions of your project?

* What are some concrete immediate first/next steps in your projects?

* What open data sets do you plan to work with? (Show that the data set(s) you
  plan to work with are indeed open.)

* What are possible ties to Wikipedia (or any Wikimedia related projects)?

* What challenges do you anticipate running into?

* What skills will a team need to develop to solve this problem?

* In what way (if any) are you also getting credit for work you are planning to
  do in this project in another UC Berkeley course?

Make sure:

* Your project is listed under the [Project Ideas](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.ambnowk87ix) section
* You link to the project in the [Who's Interested in What?](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.vdzddpatp9vq) section under your name.
* By specific data, I mean something you can
meaningfully use what we have learned to produce a pandas `DataFrame` and answer a useful (even if simple and preliminary) question. List the
data source in the project idea section.
