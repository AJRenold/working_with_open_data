[EPD Free](http://enthought.com/products/epd_free.php) works ok for the core of what we're doing in class
and for what's presented in *PfDA*.

The [EPD Academic
Subscription](http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php) gives any
academic user access, free of charge, to all the modules in the [EPD subscriber
repository](https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/). You have to [login on
enthought.com](https://www.enthought.com/accounts/login/?next=/repo/epd/) to
access [EPD subscriber repository](https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/).

See the [list of what's in or not in the EPD free
distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epdlibraries.php). You'll
notice, for example, that the [VTK module](http://www.vtk.org/) -- a 3d-viz
toolkit -- is not included in the free distro-- so if you want to run it, sign
up for the academic subscription.

[Enthought mailing list](https://mail.enthought.com/mailman/listinfo/epd-users) might be a good place
to ask installation-related questions.
