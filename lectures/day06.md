# Enthought 

[EPD Free](http://enthought.com/products/epd_free.php) works ok for the core of what we're doing in class
and for what's presented in *PfDA*.

The [EPD Academic
Subscription](http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php) gives any
academic user access, free of charge, to all the modules in the [EPD subscriber
repository](https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/). You have to [login on
enthought.com](https://www.enthought.com/accounts/login/?next=/repo/epd/) to
access [EPD subscriber repository](https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/).

See the [list of what's in or not in the EPD free
distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epdlibraries.php). You'll
notice, for example, that the [VTK module](http://www.vtk.org/) -- a 3d-viz
toolkit -- is not included in the free distro-- so if you want to run it, sign
up for the academic subscription.

[Enthought mailing list](https://mail.enthought.com/mailman/listinfo/epd-users) might be a good place
to ask installation-related questions.

# Please use Piazza!

If you have questions that aren't personal in nature, please use Piazza to pose the question.  That will give not only me and Jacob
the chance to answer your question, but it'd open it up to all -- thanks!

# Homework

I would like everyone to fill in at least one Project idea in [Project Ideas/Team Formation gdoc](http://bit.ly/wwod13projideas) and email
me a link (+description) to that project idea in email to <yee@berkeley.edu> by Monday, Feb 11, 2013 at noon.
