# Homework from Day 4 Graded

I've graded all the HW Day 4 notebooks (aka the 2nd assignment) that I've
received and have posted the grades on bspace. Full marks = 8. I used the same
basic scheme as I did for the first assignment (which was out of 4) but doubled
the weight. I'm taking resubmissions until the end of this week -- my big goal
is to work with you to stay on track with the class materials.

## Reminder of what I do in grading

* I glance through your notebook looking for the way you answered the questions.
* I clear all the results.
* I run the notebook.

**Please don't alter the assertions/tests I run in.  If you do, you must highlight the change you made and why.**

I allow resubmissions because I want to encourage you to learn the material and because I do want dialog in the
learning process.
