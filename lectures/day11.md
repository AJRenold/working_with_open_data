% Day 11: Project Proposals and Pandas!
% Raymond Yee 
% February 25, 2013 (<http://bit.ly/wwod1311>)

# Agenda

Our priorities:

* Make progress on project proposals
* prepare for visit from Harrison Dekker and Tim Dennis of the [UC Data
  Lab](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/wikis/datalab/), who will help us learn how
  to use the data resources of UC Berkeley.

# Visit from UC Data Lab folks

Add your questions and data sets to
[data sets you are looking and and any questions you have for Harrison and Tim](http://bit.ly/wwod13datalab)

# Projects and Pandas

I want everyone to identify a **specific** data set tied to a project idea today on [Project Ideas/ Proposals for WwOD 2013](http://bit.ly/wwod13projideas):

* Your project is listed under the [Project Ideas](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.ambnowk87ix) section
* You link to the project in the [Who's Interested in What?](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZMZcai8k5YA-_re_ZWhdQFwTk0xmTbQP0UIaDlb72lE/edit#heading=h.vdzddpatp9vq) section under your name.
* By specific data, I mean something you can
meaningfully use what we have learned to produce a pandas `DataFrame` and answer a useful (even if simple and preliminary) question. List the
data source in the project idea section.

# Reminder: Project Requirements:

* 2-4 people.
* Must involve in a non-trivial manner some open data -- though you are welcome to use closed data also 
* Deadline for project proposal/team formation is Friday, March 8, 2013 at noon

# Refining project proposals

To the questions I've already posed about projects:

* What open data sets might you be working with?
* Possible ties to Wikipedia (or any Wikimedia related projects)?
* What challenges do you anticipate running into?
* What skills will a team need to develop to solve this problem?

I'll add two more to consider:

* What are some open ended questions of your project? 
* What are some immediate next steps in your projects?

# If you are looking a project to work on....

I have some project ideas:

* Bach!
* Books!
* Berkeley!
* Brian's Bailiwick! (i.e., CourtListener)
* Bisecting Big Brother! (org chart for the US Federal Goverment)
* Building Blocks!

# Homework

**We will work on this in class today.**
